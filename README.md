# Neutron

A lightweight, fast bookmarking tool for saving and organizing articles and web content.

## Why Neutron?

I built Neutron out of necessity. While there are many note-taking and bookmarking apps available, I found that:

- Notion was too heavy and slow to load on my PC
- I prefer Obsidian for detailed note-taking and thought organization
- Got too lazy to lookup andy good ones, i did find one matter but i use an android too bad
- I needed something that just worked, quickly and efficiently
